Slowly everything is falling into place for our upcoming workshop! The Youth Hostel is reserved, and we've secured rooms at the Klimaarena (big thanks for this fantastic collaboration!). And we are thrilled to have Kathrin Zangerl, expert in climate change and child health, on board. Stay tuned for further updates 🌟🏨🌿!
