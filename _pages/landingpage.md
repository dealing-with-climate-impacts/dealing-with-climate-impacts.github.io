Global warming affects living-conditions on Earth. The civil society and political stakeholders on the communal level are therefore faced with the challenge of implementing climate change mitigation and adaptation to protect people from direct and indirect consequences of the climate crisis. This 4-days transdisciplinary workshop for practitioners and scientists aims at developing and evaluating best practices in local climate action by bringing together people engaged in climate action on a societal, political and scientific level.  

## Learn, Connect, and Strengthen Climate Action Efforts 

- Understand the direct and indirect risks from local climate change
- Exchange, develop and evaluate ideas to increase efficiency and evaluation of implemented measures at local scale 
- Identify needs of local practitioners and the potential of action-informed science 
- Connect with each other and within the BAN to bring together expertise from different disciplines and perspectives
- Strengthen collaboration at the science-policy interface 

## Participation

- Workshop language: English
- Date & venue: 23.-26.11.2023, Heidelberg, Germany
- Lodging (Single rooms at the Youth Hostel in Heidelberg) and food (vegan / vegetarian) will be covered
- Travel allowance will be partially covered (e.g., approx. 75% for 2nd class train tickets in Germany) 
- Conference rooms at Heidelberg Center for the Environment [Marsiliuskolleg](https://www.hce.uni-heidelberg.de/en) and visit at the [Klimaarena](https://klima-arena.de/) in Sinsheim

## Schedule 

The workshop contains two future lab workshops in which the participants will assess the local impacts of global warming and develop ideas to be implemented for closing the knowledge-action gap in their projects. In these future labs, common methods will be used that combine design thinking, co-creation and scenario techniques to develop an outcome product in the form of a policy paper that can be shared within the BAN network and potentially beyond.
