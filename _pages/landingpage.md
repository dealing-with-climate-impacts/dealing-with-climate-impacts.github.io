Global warming affects living-conditions on Earth. The civil society and political stakeholders on the communal level are therefore faced with the challenge of implementing climate change mitigation and adaptation to protect people from direct and indirect consequences of the climate crisis. This 4-days transdisciplinary workshop for practitioners and scientists aims at developing and evaluating best practices in local climate action by bringing together people engaged in climate action on a societal, political and scientific level.  

### Learn, connect, and strengthen climate action efforts 

- Understand the direct and indirect risks from local climate change
- Exchange, develop and evaluate ideas to increase efficiency and evaluation of implemented measures at local scale 
- Identify needs of local practitioners and the potential of action-informed science 
- Connect with each other and within the BAN to bring together expertise from different disciplines and perspectives
- Strengthen collaboration at the science-policy interface 

### Participation

- Workshop language: English
- Date & venue: 23.-26.11.2023, Heidelberg, Germany
- Lodging (Single rooms at the Youth Hostel in Heidelberg) and food (vegan / vegetarian) will be covered
- Travel allowance will be partially covered (according to the BAN rules for reimbursement of travel costs) 
- Conference rooms at Heidelberg Center for the Environment [Marsiliuskolleg](https://www.hce.uni-heidelberg.de/en) and visit at the [Klimaarena](https://klima-arena.de/) in Sinsheim

### Schedule 

The workshop contains two future lab workshops in which the participants will assess the local impacts of global warming and develop ideas to be implemented for closing the knowledge-action gap in their projects. In these future labs, common methods will be used that combine design thinking, co-creation and scenario techniques to develop an outcome product in the form of a policy paper that can be shared within the BAN network and potentially beyond.

### Team

Dr. Beatrice Ellerhoff is a physicst, climate scientist, and science communicator dedicated to translating research findings into real-world solutions. Her expertise spans from local temperature change, climate extremes and variability, where she earned her PhD, to diverse digital subjects like AI and quantum computing, which she passionately explored in her [book](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-658-31222-0). Bea is working in the field of greenhouse gas monitoring at Deutscher Wetterdienst, aiming to bridge the gaps between science and society to address the challenges posed by global warming.

Dr. Maximilian Jungmann (political scientist, strategy consultant) is founder and managing director of [Momentum Novum](https://de.mnovum.com/). Max is also the Executive Manager of the Heidelberg Center for the Environment at the University of Heidelberg. He holds a PhD in Political Science on health policy challenges of climate change. He teaches on climate policy, leadership, innovation management, negotiation techniques, project management and strategic foresight at the Chair of International Relations and Foreign Policy at the University of Heidelberg, at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), at the Steinbeis Business Academy (SBA), at the Steinbeis School of International Business and Entrepreneurship (SIBE) and at the German Federal Foreign Office. Max is a Climate Reality Leader and served for years on the senior staff of the largest UN simulation in the world, the National Model United Nations New York.

Dr. med. univ., M.Sc. Kathi Zangerl is a specialist paediatrician, global child health advocate and researcher who is deeply commited to advancing child health policy concerning global preparedness under climate change. Kathi is interested in exploring co-creation methods to develop child-centered adaptation interventions that enhance child health outcomes amidst the challenges of climate change.
